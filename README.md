# ForceFieldPotential (FFP) V2 - called "Stranger Fields"

A Serious Game to help students learn about forces and potentials, developed on the Unity game engine in C# using an Entity-Component-System architectural pattern. It is a mobile game.

To complete a level, you have to destroy the enemy planet and not lose your spaceship.
In order to do so, you can fire missiles, change the initial launching power and the rotation of your ship. You also have to place force fields (sort of black holes and "white" holes) in the world to "guide" your missiles in the right direction. Be careful to not get hit by enemies, they recalculate a trajectory towards your ship everytime you fire.

The development of the game started as a project for a course during my Master's Degree at UPMC (Pierre et Marie Curie University), Paris, in 2017-2018. Then, I continued to work on it with another team (with game designers and intern graphic artists) during my end of study internship.
